                <p>A work-in-progress 3D engine written in C that aims at being as portable as possible. It has its own 3D file and texture format (called pear3d), and ships with a tool to convert from most usual formats to pear3d.</p>
                <p>pear can load 3D models (only in the pear3d format), display them, has <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Light-casters" target="_blank">simple lights</a> and implements the <a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear" target="_blank">Nuklear</a> library for the GUI. The current graphical API is OpenGL, but my goal is to make the engine work with Vulkan as well. Porting the engine to consoles as a homebrew application could be fun as well.</p>
                <p>This is a hobby project of mine that I work on when I have time to.</p>

                <p>A Sudoku game written in C that I and friends created for school. It can generate sudoku grids randomly, the player can input the digit they want into the grid, or the program can solve it automatically using a mix of cool algorithms and backtracking in less than 0.03 seconds for the most difficult grids.</p>
                <p>You can also load grids written in a custom format, and I programmed the entire UI by myself, featuring a theming system!</p>

                <p>A text editor that I made for fun because I was bored. I think it didn't turn out that bad considering I didn't spend a lot of time on it. It uses <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">Dear ImGui</a> for the GUI.</p>

                <p>An implementation of the <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" target="_blank"><cite>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</cite></a> book in Rust! It can load OBJ models and render them. Also it's painfully slow, even for my standards.</p>
